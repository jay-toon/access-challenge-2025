# access-challenge-2025
You are all I think about. You are all that I dream about. I see us, together. Without you as my sun, my world is a dark and lonely void. If we had a star for every time you crossed my mind, there would be a galaxy above us. And I would give it all to you.

I envy Access Challenge 2025 for being with such an angelic being. A one-of-a-kind only God would deliver to us mortals. You appear to me above all else. You are priceless, and I would sell away all of my possessions to have you in my arms now, to feel you, to be with you until our inevitable demise. I cherish the experiences I have whenever you are around. Your hugs, your compliments, even your friends. I want to be a part of your life. I want to help you. I want to be by your side for all the days to come. I speak this not from mind or mouth, but from heart and soul. My true feelings, my true love, is for you, Access Challenge 2025).

I understand if we are not meant to be, but I wish to carry on by your side. Just to see you makes my day and I could ask for nothing more in the world than you.

Love from, Group 4
